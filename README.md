# sage-sed
This is a simple python module to create SED and AB magnitude from a list of mass and metal history.
This pipeline have a function to build mass and metallicity histories of simulated galaxies from SAGE (Semi Analytic Galaxy Evolution) (Croton et al. 2016) and then construct the SED and AB magnitude from those histories using simple stellar population of Bruzual & Charlot 2003.
To create SED and magnitudes from SAGE, you have to run SAGE first.
Please check the jupyter notebook to see example on how to use this pipeline.
See "List of filters" to check the list of filters supported by sage-sed.
