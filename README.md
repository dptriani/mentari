# sage-sed
This is a simple python module to create SED and AB magnitude of simulated galaxies from SAGE (Semi Analytic Galaxy Evolution) (Croton et al. 2016).
You first need to run SAGE and specify the directory where you have the results. 
Please check the jupyter notebook to see example on how to use this pipeline.
