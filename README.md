# sage-sed
This is a simple python module to create SED and AB magnitude of simulated galaxies from SAGE (Semi Analytic Galaxy Evolution) (Croton et al. 2016).
You only need to run sage and specify the directory in which you have the results. 
There is a tutorial in jupyter notebook provided to help.
